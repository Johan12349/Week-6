# what I was trying to do
I tried to read amd understand the topic models and read the readings.

## how it might connect to other research I'm doing

The connections to research stems, again, primarily from sociology and anthropology courses I took which delt with issues like the ones discussed in the Why the Whiteness of Archaeology Is aÂ Problem article. In addition there are extensive research and papers I have done regarding the Parthenon/Elgin marbles.

## what I did

+ Listened to podcast
	+ gained knowledge of what to do for the week and general knowledge about digital archaeology
+ read the readings
	+ basic understanding of reading topics gained
+ Tried to read and understand the topic models
	+ got rather overwhelmed with the sheer amount of data and the unfamiliar ways in which it was represented.


## challenges 
My biggest challenge was trying to understand the data on the topic models, I think I have a general understanding but I probably need to do a bit more to fully get things.
## thoughts on where to go next

I plan to do some further viewing of the topic models over the reading week, as well as trying to do the KoBoToolbox stuff.
